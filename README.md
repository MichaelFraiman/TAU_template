# Readme

## What is this?

This is a template used to produce ODE materials for semester א of the year ה׳תשפ׳׳ד at TAU.
Apart from the style files, one actual use-case file is shared.

## What state is it in?

Raw.
The design has been adapted to the fonts which are not shared here (Meta Serif, Helvetica).
Although, you can probably use Google Noto Fonts (create a `fonts` folder and put them there);
    you need also Hebrew and Arabic Noto.

Currently there is not much customisation available.
It was also tuned to just the English language and headers in Hebrew and Arabic.
Bidirectional typesetting is currently messed up, but I am working on it.

## How to use?

Compile and watch with `compile.py` and `watch.py`.
You can do `python3 compile.py file`, where `file` can be `.typ` or `.pdf` (or just with a trailing period or without it).

## Note

1. This file will probably be updated retroactively as it is a copy of the working-directory file.
2. Currently Typst is unstable, so beware of the future changes (I think you need v.0.11 to compile this).
3. Features will be added in the future.
